# Bank Marketting
 This repository contains a classification model for the UCI Bank Direct Marketting data set.  Its structure is inspired by https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/ , but does not mimic it entirely due to time limitations.  The code would ordinarily be docker-ised and initiated with Makefiles.
